\section{Purpose}

This document is to outline how the subtyping method, referred to as
Typey, works. It is intended to be quite details, so I can implement
from it.

\section{The Principle}

Each function has a type, for example \T{head :: [a] -> a}. Lets
consider the possible values for \T{[a]}.

\[ \langle \lst \rangle ,
   \langle : \rangle a
 \]
